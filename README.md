# Chicago, IL -- Police Reform Evaluation

In September 2021, Chicago piloted a new public service, the crisis response team, CARE.
CARE operates in several different modalities; team-with-cop, team-without-cop, and opiod-response.

The idea is to use diff-in-diff and geospatial regression discontinuity to evaluate the causal impact on suicides, overdoses and crime.
If mental health clinicians can reduce deaths of despair, there's a financial and moral case to be made.
