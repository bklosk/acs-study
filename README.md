# Chicago, IL -- Police Reform Evaluation

In September 2021, Chicago piloted a new public service, the crisis response team, CARE.

The idea is to use triple diff-in-diff and geospatial regression discontinuity to evaluate the causal impact on suicides, overdoses and crime.
CARE operates in three different modalities; team-with-cop, team-without-cop, and opiod-response.

If alternate response teams can reduce crime by responding to 911 calls, we should implement this model on a much broader scale.
